# Caglar Oksuz

Welcome to my personal academic webpage! I am a Ph.D. candidate in Computer Science at Case Western Reserve University, with a strong focus on machine learning security, privacy, and adversarial robustness. My research centers around black-box threats against machine learning models such as model extraction and label-only membership inference attacks, particularly under realistic, resource-constrained scenarios. I also explore how explainable AI (XAI) techniques can inadvertently leak sensitive model information, and how such vulnerabilities can be exploited and mitigated.

I develop attack frameworks and privacy-preserving mechanisms across various domains including genomic data, web platforms, and ML-as-a-Service environments. I actively build tools and conduct evaluations that push the boundaries of adversarial machine learning research while maintaining a strong interest in policy, ethics, and law through my parallel legal education.

My work focuses on:
- **Privacy**
- **Computer Security**
- **Explainable AI (XAI)**
- **Adversarial Machine Learning**

## üíº Experience

**Graduate Researcher @ Case Western Reserve University (_Aug 2021 ‚Äì present_)**  
- Assisted courses of Data Structures, and Data Privacy by grading and tutoring.  
- Built a novel model extraction attack framework leveraging Explainable AI (XAI) tools LIME and SHAP to replicate black-box models from MLaaS platforms (Google Cloud, IBM Watson). Reduced query overhead by up to 240x on select datasets. Utilized Python, scikit-learn, NumPy, Pandas, Git, and containerized deployment via Docker. [GitHub](https://github.com/acoksuz)  
- Implemented a query-efficient, label-only membership inference framework on neural networks using active-learning and transfer-learning-based model extraction. Performed hyperparameter optimization via grid search, integrated privacy defenses (DP-SGD, adversarial training, L2 regularization), and managed model training workflows with PyTorch.

**Graduate Researcher @ Bilkent University (_Sep 2017 ‚Äì Aug 2020_)**  
- Assisted courses of Introduction to Programming I & II, and Artificial Intelligence by grading and tutoring.  
- Developed a privacy-preserving watermarking scheme for genomic data, using local differential privacy (LDP) in MATLAB. Achieved up to 80% detection rate with under 5% utility loss against collusion attacks. [GitHub](https://github.com/acoksuz)

**Software Engineering Intern @ ASELSAN (_Jul 2015 ‚Äì Aug 2015_)**  
- Engineered and deployed a highly responsive user interface and control panel for military hardware. Utilized ASP.NET MVC 5 for robust back-end functionality and integrated HTML5, CSS3, and C# for a dynamic front-end design. This system was adopted as an official prototype.
 
**Software Engineering Intern @ Nokta Medya (_Aug 2014- Sep 2014_)** 
- Developed an automated content moderation algorithm to speed up content moderation, reduced response time by 21%, and improved platform compliance using Python and data-driven insights.  
- Tracked, analyzed, and reported daily website analytics using Google Analytics, Microsoft Excel and SQL, identifying trends that increased user engagement by 16% and retention by 12% over six months.  
- Assisted business intelligence team to lead a search engine optimization (SEO) workshop for the management and product teams. Implemented strategies that improved organic search visibility by 26%, boosting site traffic.  
- Conducted comparative analysis between the product features of video sharing platforms izlesene.com, YouTube, Dailymotion and Vimeo. Delivered a presentation to department heads and the CEO key opportunities that resulted in the adoption of 3 key product features and increasing the adaptability of the product by 30%.
